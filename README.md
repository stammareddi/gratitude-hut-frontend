## About 
How wonderful does it feel to be thankful and appreciative, even for the small things we experience in everyday life.
This is an open source project that allows you to journal your moments in life and be able to view them with ease.

## Motivation 
I am a person who journals everday on a piece of paper and pencil.Yes I'm old fashioned However, I found myself not viewing my old entries once I written them and that always bothered me. Moreoever, after adding the MERN stack under my belt I decided to test my abilities by creating this application. The main purpose of this applcation was for me to empahsie  get a better understanding of the stack as well as



## Hosting applcation 

* What will you achieve in the process of hosting this applcation ? 
   - Will get setup with node.js if not downloaded already. [What is node.js?](https://www.w3schools.com/nodejs/nodejs_intro.asp)
   -  Will set up a database connection to your mongoDB. [What is mongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/what-is-mongodb)


1.  Clone the repo (click on the green code button at the top and download zip) and open it up in your code editor alongside a terminal  
2. Checking if node.js is installed 
    - Do `node -v` in your terminal to check if already installed and to check version number.
         -  If installed it will say v and version number : v10.16.13
     -  To download node [click here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and run the command again to see if installed successfully 
3. Do `npm install package.json` in the terminal. This json file allows the project to install the versions of the modules it depends on.By running this command inside of your project, you can install all the dependencies that are listed in the project's package.
4. Great your frontend of the application is all setup head over to [Gratitude-hut backend repository](https://github.com/stammareddi/gratitude-hut-backend) to establish a database connection to be able to save your data to a database
5. Welcome back! the final step is to run `npm start`



* Connecting to backend
  1. To be able to save your data you would need a connection vist [MongoDb](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login) and sign up for an account

  3.  Once you have finished the preivous step go ahead to the [Gratitude-hut backend repo](https://github.com/stammareddi/gratitude-hut-backend) to install the backend part of the application.
